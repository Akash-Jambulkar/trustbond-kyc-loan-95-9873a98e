# TrustBond: Blockchain-Based KYC & Loan Management Platform

## Project Overview

TrustBond is a decentralized platform that leverages blockchain technology to streamline the Know Your Customer (KYC) verification process and loan management for financial institutions. The platform creates a secure, transparent ecosystem where individuals can submit KYC documents once and share them with multiple financial institutions while maintaining control over their personal data. Banks can verify users, calculate trust scores, and manage loan applications within a unified system.

## Core Features

### KYC Management
- Document submission and verification
- Blockchain-based document hashing for integrity
- Hybrid data architecture (blockchain + traditional database)
- Secure document sharing between institutions

### Trust Score System
- Algorithmic trust calculation based on verified credentials
- Transparent scoring mechanism
- Immutable score history

### Loan Management 
- Streamlined loan application process
- Bank approval workflow
- Automated credit assessment
- Loan repayment tracking

### User Roles
- **Individual Users**: Submit KYC documents, apply for loans
- **Banks**: Verify user KYCs, manage loan applications
- **Administrators**: Platform oversight and management

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React**: UI library for building the user interface
- **TypeScript**: Typed JavaScript for enhanced code quality
- **Vite**: Build tool and development server
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Shadcn UI**: Component library for UI elements
- **React Router**: For application routing
- **React Query**: For data fetching, caching, and state management
- **Recharts**: For data visualization components
- **Ethers.js**: For blockchain interactions
- **Sonner**: For toast notifications

### Blockchain
- **Ethereum**: Underlying blockchain platform
- **Smart Contracts**: For KYC verification, trust score calculation, and loan management
- **Web3 Provider**: MetaMask wallet integration for blockchain interactions

### Backend
- **MongoDB**: Document database for storing document metadata and application data
- **Node.js**: (Implied) For backend API services
- **API Services**: For hybrid data model (blockchain + traditional database)

## Architecture Overview

TrustBond employs a hybrid architecture:

1. **Blockchain Layer**: 
   - Stores verification status, document hashes, and loan contracts
   - Provides immutability, transparency, and cryptographic security
   - Smart contracts handle business logic for verifications and loans

2. **Traditional Database Layer**:
   - Stores document metadata, user information, and application data
   - Ensures performance and flexibility for complex queries
   - Reduces blockchain transaction costs by storing only essential data on-chain

3. **Frontend Application**:
   - React-based single-page application
   - Connects to both blockchain and database through service layers
   - Responsive design for various devices

## Smart Contracts

The platform utilizes several smart contracts:

1. **Role Management Contract**: Manages user roles (individual, bank, admin)
2. **KYC Contract**: Handles document submission and verification
3. **Trust Score Contract**: Calculates and manages user trust scores
4. **Loan Management Contract**: Handles loan applications, approvals, and repayments

## Blockchain Integration

The application connects to the Ethereum blockchain via MetaMask or similar Web3 providers, allowing users to:

1. Submit document hashes to the blockchain for verification
2. Check verification status of documents
3. Apply for loans through smart contracts
4. Verify and approve KYC documents (for banks)
5. Calculate trust scores based on verified documents

## Environment Variables

The application requires the following environment variables:

```
# Blockchain Configuration
VITE_INFURA_PROJECT_ID=your_infura_project_id
VITE_NETWORK_ID=network_id
VITE_KYC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x123...
VITE_ROLE_MANAGEMENT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x456...
VITE_TRUST_SCORE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x789...
VITE_LOAN_MANAGEMENT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xabc...

# Database Configuration
VITE_MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

# API Configuration
VITE_API_BASE_URL=your_api_base_url

# Optional: Analytics & Monitoring
VITE_ANALYTICS_ID=your_analytics_id
```

## API Services

The application interacts with several services:

### Blockchain Services
- `providerService.ts`: Handles Web3 provider connections
- `kycService.ts`: Interfaces with the KYC smart contract
- `roleManagementService.ts`: Manages user roles
- `trustScoreService.ts`: Calculates and retrieves trust scores
- `loanManagementService.ts`: Handles loan operations
- `analyticsService.ts`: Provides blockchain analytics

### Database Services
- `kycService.ts`: Stores and retrieves KYC document metadata
- `userService.ts`: Manages user information
- `mongoConnection.ts`: Handles database connections

## Development Setup

To set up the project for development:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Create a `.env` file with the required environment variables
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

## Production Deployment

For production deployment:

1. Build the application: `npm run build`
2. Deploy the built files to a static hosting service
3. Configure environment variables in your hosting environment

## Security Considerations

- Document data is stored off-chain for privacy
- Only document hashes are stored on the blockchain
- Role-based access control for feature access
- Proper authentication and authorization checks
- Smart contract security best practices implemented

## Future Enhancements

- Multi-chain support for various blockchain networks
- Advanced analytics for risk assessment
- Mobile application development
- Integration with traditional banking systems
- Regulatory compliance automation
- Enhanced privacy features with zero-knowledge proofs
